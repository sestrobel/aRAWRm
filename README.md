Welcome to aRAWRm, an alarm you can't help but love! 

What we did was implant a Bluetooth-enabled Ardino into a toy tiger (the aRAWRm) and created an app that can activate the 
buzzer to play the Mario theme, activate the multi-colored LED, or set the desired time you wish to sleep. 
The app will send a signal to the aRAWRm once the time is up and activate the LED and buzzer to wake you.

On the app side, we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make a simple UI that allows a user to automatically connect with the 
Arduino in the aRAWRm using BluetoothLE technology and control its expanding features. We utilized Evothings 2.1.0. You must import 
our app file into this platform to use it at this time. (You also need to get your hands on the aRAWRm prototype!)
